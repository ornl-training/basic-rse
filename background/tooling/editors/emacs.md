Emacs (Editor MACroS) is a familiy of extensible text editors, the most popular being GNU Emacs which is based on a dialect of the Lisp programming language which makes it very extensible. Emacs power lies on its several thousands built-in commands. There is typically an emacs extension for every new available functionality. 

Emacs is portable across several systems and it dates back to the 1970s and it is still under development*.

*Note: stick to GNU Emacs, some related projects XEmacs are not under active development.
