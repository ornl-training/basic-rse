# ReST, Sphinx and readthedocs.org

Using ReST, Sphinx and readthdocs.org allows online documentation for your project: user guide, developers guide, specs, best practices, etc. with minimal overhead. They have expandable capabilities, through package extesions, to automatically integrate different styles for formatting and artwork, as well as API docs from doxygen (breathe extension). In addition, these products allow versioning mechanics for your, docs so they can be in sync with your current source code and releases.

**ReST**: reStructured TexT is a lightweight markup language for plain text files. Provides a simple syntax to use and extend functionality via packages annotations.

**Sphinx**: is the tool that allows ReST documents to be converted to typical publication formats (html, pdf) through annotations.

**readthedocs.org**: free hosting documentation service for publishable Sphinx content. Its major advantage is that it's synchronized with github. If your docs source code in ReST format are hosted and updated, this will be reflected automatically on readthedocs.

**NOTE**

Latex users can see the analogy between the above products: ReST -> .tex format, Sphinx -> latex/latexmk converters, Readthedocs -> publication venue
